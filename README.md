# Poetic Python

> *Readable code is remembered. Elegant code is revisited.*

**Poetic Python** is my personal Python reference repository — a place to collect
clear explanations, Pythonic patterns, and well-written examples that are easy to
revisit and understand at a glance.

This repo exists primarily as a **long-term memory vault** for myself.  
If others find it helpful, that’s a welcome bonus.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Quickly **refresh concepts** without rereading full docs
- Capture **Pythonic idioms** and mental models
- Store **clean, expressive examples** worth remembering
- Build intuition, not just syntax recall

This is not a tutorial series or a framework repo.
It’s a **thinking companion**.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Python is often described as *executable poetry*.
This repo embraces that idea:

- Prefer **clarity over cleverness**
- Prefer **readability over brevity**
- Prefer **explicit intent** over hidden magic

If a piece of code feels good to read, it belongs here.

## 📂 Structure (evolving)

The structure is flexible and grows organically.

Typical sections may include:

- `basics/` — fundamentals worth revisiting
- `idioms/` — Pythonic patterns & conventions
- `data-structures/` — lists, dicts, sets, tuples (with intent)
- `functions/` — arguments, closures, decorators
- `oop/` — classes, dunder methods, design choices
- `async-concurrency/` — async, threading, multiprocessing
- `stdlib-notes/` — useful standard library modules
- `snippets/` — small ideas that don’t need a category

Not everything must fit perfectly.  
The goal is **recall**, not taxonomy perfection.

## ✍️ Writing Style

Each note or example aims to be:

- Short and focused
- Clearly commented
- Easy to skim later
- Free of unnecessary abstraction

If something needs excessive explanation, it probably doesn’t belong here.

## 🚧 What This Repo Is NOT

- ❌ A beginner-only course
- ❌ A copy of official documentation
- ❌ A framework-specific codebase
- ❌ A production-ready template

It’s a **personal Python notebook**, refined over time.

## 🤝 For Visitors

Feel free to:
- Browse
- Learn
- Borrow ideas
- Use snippets as inspiration

But keep in mind:  
This repo optimizes for **my memory and understanding first**.

---

## 🌱 Status

This repository is **alive**.
Notes will be added, rewritten, or removed as my understanding deepens.

Poetry improves with revision.
