# Beginner-Friendly Guide to Python

_A complete guide for absolute beginners — simple English, clear examples._

## 1. What is Python?

Python is a **high-level**, **beginner-friendly**, **general-purpose** programming language.  
It is used for web development, data science, machine learning, automation, backend development, cybersecurity, and DevOps.

Python is famous because it is readable and simple. Example:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
``` 

## 2. A Short History of Python

**How Python Was Born**

- Created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1989**.
- First released in **1991**.
- Guido wanted a language that was simple, readable, and powerful.
- Named after the comedy group **“Monty Python”**, not the snake.

**Evolution**

- **Python 2** (2000): Easy scripting but had design limitations.
- **Python 3** (2008): Modernized, cleaned up issues from Python 2.
- Python 3 is now the main version used worldwide.

**Why Python Became Popular**

- Readable and easy to write.
- Less code → more productivity.
- Huge ecosystem: Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, etc.
- High demand in 2026: Backend developers, AI/ML engineers, and data scientists prefer Python.

## 3. How Python Runs

Python is commonly called an **interpreted language**, but its process is a mix of interpreting and compiling.

### How Python Executes Code (Step by Step)

When you run a Python file:

1. **You write `.py` code**
2. Python **compiles it into bytecode** (`.pyc` files)
3. The **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** executes the bytecode

This makes Python flexible and portable.

## Different Implementations of Python

### 1. CPython (The Default)

- Most popular version
- Written in C
- Converts Python code → bytecode → interprets it
- What you get when you install Python from python.org

### 2. Jython

- Runs Python on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**
- Lets you use Java libraries in Python
- Useful in Java-heavy companies

### 3. PyPy

- Faster implementation of Python
- Uses a **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler
- Good for performance-heavy tasks

## Why Python Uses This Design

Python focuses on:

- **simplicity**
- **developer productivity**
- **flexibility**

If Python compiled directly to machine code like C or Go:

- code would be harder to write
- dynamic typing would be more limited
- debugging would be less friendly

Python chooses simplicity and flexibility over raw speed, which is why it remains one of the best beginner languages.
