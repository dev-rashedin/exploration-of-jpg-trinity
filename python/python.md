## 1. What is Python?

Python is a **high-level**, **beginner-friendly**, **general-purpose** programming language.  
It is used for web development, data science, machine learning, automation, backend development, cybersecurity, and DevOps.  

Python is famous because it is readable and simple. Example:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

## 2. A Short History of Python

**How Python Was Born**  
- Created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1989**.  
- First released in **1991**.  
- Guido wanted a language that was simple, readable, and powerful.  
- Named after the comedy group **“Monty Python”**, not the snake.

**Evolution**  
- **Python 2** (2000): Easy scripting but had design limitations.  
- **Python 3** (2008): Modernized, cleaned up issues from Python 2.  
- Python 3 is now the main version used worldwide.

**Why Python Became Popular**  
- Readable and easy to write.  
- Less code → more productivity.  
- Huge ecosystem: Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, etc.  
- High demand in 2026: Backend developers, AI/ML engineers, and data scientists prefer Python.

## 3. How Python Runs

Python is an **interpreted language**, meaning it doesn't compile directly to machine code. It runs inside a **Python interpreter**.  
There are several implementations:
- **CPython**: The standard implementation in C. Most widely used.  
- **Jython**: Python that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  
- **PyPy**: Python with a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for faster execution.

This design explains why Python is slower than C but highly flexible, easy to debug, and platform-independent.

## 4. Python Basics

### 4.1 Variables and Data Types
```python
name = "Alice"   # string
age = 25         # integer
height = 5.7     # float
is_student = True # boolean
```

### 4.2 Operators
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`

### 4.3 Control Flow
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

### 4.4 Loops
```python
# for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### 4.5 Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

### 4.6 Lists and Dictionaries
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # apple

person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person["name"])  # Alice
```

### 4.7 Basic Input/Output
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## 5. Conclusion

Python is **beginner-friendly**, **versatile**, and has a **huge ecosystem**.  
Its readable syntax, flexibility, and demand make it an excellent first programming language.  

Whether you want to do **web development**, **AI**, or **automation**, Python is the go-to choice for beginners in 2026 and beyond.
