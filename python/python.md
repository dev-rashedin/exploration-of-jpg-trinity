*A complete guide for absolute beginners — simple English, clear examples.*

## 1. What is Python?

Python is a **high-level**, **beginner-friendly**, **general-purpose** programming language.  
It is used for web development, data science, machine learning, automation, backend development, cybersecurity, and DevOps.  

Python is famous because it is readable and simple. Example:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

## 2. A Short History of Python

**How Python Was Born**  
- Created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1989**.  
- First released in **1991**.  
- Guido wanted a language that was simple, readable, and powerful.  
- Named after the comedy group **“Monty Python”**, not the snake.

**Evolution**  
- **Python 2** (2000): Easy scripting but had design limitations.  
- **Python 3** (2008): Modernized, cleaned up issues from Python 2.  
- Python 3 is now the main version used worldwide.

**Why Python Became Popular**  
- Readable and easy to write.  
- Less code → more productivity.  
- Huge ecosystem: Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, etc.  
- High demand in 2026: Backend developers, AI/ML engineers, and data scientists prefer Python.

## 3. How Python Runs

Python is an **interpreted language**, meaning it doesn't compile directly to machine code. It runs inside a **Python interpreter**.  
There are several implementations:
- **CPython**: The standard implementation in C. Most widely used.  
- **Jython**: Python that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  
- **PyPy**: Python with a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for faster execution.

This design explains why Python is slower than C but highly flexible, easy to debug, and platform-independent.

## 4. Python Basics

Python is simple, but powerful. This section explains its core building blocks in beginner‑friendly language with examples.

## 4.1 Variables and Data Types

A **variable** is a container that stores a value.  
Think of it like a labeled box where you keep information.

### Key Points
- Variables store data such as text, numbers, true/false values, lists, etc.
- Variables are **case‑sensitive** (`name` and `Name` are different).
- Python uses **dynamic typing**, meaning you don’t have to declare a type.

### Example
```python
name = "Alice"       # string
age = 25             # integer
height = 5.7         # float
is_student = True    # boolean
```

---

## Typecasting

**Typecasting** means converting one data type into another.

### Built‑in Functions
- `str()` → convert to string  
- `int()` → convert to integer  
- `float()` → convert to floating number  
- `bool()` → convert to boolean  

### Example
```python
age = "25"
age_number = int(age)   # "25" → 25 (integer)
print(type(age_number))
```

---

## input()

`input()` allows the user to enter data from the keyboard.

- Always returns data as a **string**.
- Convert it using typecasting if needed.

### Example
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # convert to integer
print("Hello,", name)
print("You are", age, "years old")
```

---

## 4.2 Operators

Operators perform actions on values.

### Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Meaning      | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| +       | Add          | 3 + 2   |
| -       | Subtract     | 5 - 1   |
| *       | Multiply     | 2 * 4   |
| /       | Divide       | 9 / 2   |
| %       | Modulus      | 10 % 3 → 1 |
| **      | Power        | 2 ** 3 → 8 |


### Built in math functions
x = 3.14
y = -4
z = 5

- result = round(x)

- result = abs(y)

- result = pow(4, 3)

- result = max(x, y, z)

result = min(x, y, z)

print(result)


### Math modules

import math

print(math.pi)
print(math.e)

result = math.sqrt(16)

result = math.ceil(2.1)

result = math.floor(2.9)

print(result)


# if Statement
 - Do some code only if some condition is True
 - Else do something else

age = int(input('Enter your age:'))

if age >= 100:
    print('You are too old to open an account')
elif age >= 18:
    print('Your are eligible to open an account')
elif age < 0:
    print("You haven't been born yet")

else:
    print('You are not eligible to open an account')


### Comparison Operators
Used to compare values (returns True or False):

`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

### Logical Operators
 - evaluate multiple conditions (or, and, not)
   - or = at least one condition must be true
   - and = all conditions must be true
   - not = reverse the condition (not False, not True)

```
temp = 15
is_sunny = False

if temp >= 28 or is_sunny:
  print('It is hot outside')
elif temp <= 15 and not is_sunny:
  print('It is a cool day')
  print('It is cloudy')
elif temp <= 0 and not is_sunny:
  print('It is freezing outside')
  print('It is cloudy')
elif 28 > temp > 0 and is_sunny:
  print('It is warm outside')
  print('It is sunny')
```

# conditional expression 
 - A one-line shortcut for the if-else statement (ternary operator)
 - Print or assign one of two values based on a condition
 - X if condition else Y

 ```
num = 5
a = 6
b = 7

print('Positive' if num > 0 else 'Negative')

print('Positive' if num > 0 else 'Negative')


result = 'Even' if num % 2 == 0 else "Odd"

max_num = a if a > b else b

print(f"The maximum number is {max_num}")

min_num = a if a < b else b

print(f"The minimum number is {min_num}")

 ```


## String method

```
name = "rashedin islam"

len(name) # Returns the length of the string

name.upper() # Returns the string in upper case

name.lower() # Returns the string in lower case

name.find('s') # Returns the index of the specified string. It will give the first index. if it is not found, it returns -1

name.rfind('a') # Returns the index of the specified string. It will give the last index. if it is not found, it returns -1

name.capitalize()  # Returns the string in title case (the first letter of the string will be in upper case )

name.title()  # Returns the string in title case (the first letter of each word will be in upper case )

name.isdigit()  # Returns True if the string contains only digits

name.isalpha()  # Returns True if the string contains only alphabetic characters

name.isnumeric()  # Returns True if the string contains only digits

name.count("a") # Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string

number.replace("", "-") # Replaces all occurrences of a specified value with another value
```


## Indexing in String

- Accessing element of a sequence using [] (indexing operator)
- [start: end : stop]

```
credit_number = "1234-45445-43213-1341"

credit_number[0] # gives the first character in the string

credit_number[0: 4] # gives the first 4 characters in the string
credit_number[: 4] # gives the first 4 characters in the string
credit_number[4: 8] # gives the next 4 characters in the credit_number[5:] # gives all characters after the 5th character in the string
credit_number[-3] # gives the number form the end
credit_number[0 : 4 : 2] # gives the first 4 characters in the string with a step of 2
credit_number[::2] # gives all characters in the string with a step of 2
```
---

## Example Program Using Everything
```python
name = input("Your name: ")

age = int(input("Your age: "))

if age >= 18 and age <= 60:
    print("Hello", name, "- You are an adult.")
elif age > 60:
    print("Hello", name, "- You are a senior.")
else:
    print("Hello", name, "- You are a minor.")

print("Age squared:", age ** 2)
print("Is your age even?", age % 2 == 0)
```


### 4.3 Control Flow
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

### 4.4 Loops
```python
# for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### 4.5 Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

### 4.6 Lists and Dictionaries
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # apple

person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person["name"])  # Alice
```
